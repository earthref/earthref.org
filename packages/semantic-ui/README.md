# LESS Distribution

This repository is automatically synced with the main [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI) repository to provide lightweight LESS only version of Semantic UI.

You can view instructions on using LESS on [LearnSemantic.com](http://www.learnsemantic.com) and in our [main repos readme](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/tree/master/src#importing-less)
